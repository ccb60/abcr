# One concept for toxenizing the tune is as follows:

# A tokenizer control system that sets flags for different interpretations

# Tokenizer uses regular expression to pull tokens one at a time in sequence

# Those tokens are then interpreted to pitches

# as I have been looking at other represenations for pitch sequences, it is
# obvious there is little consistency in the data structures used for music
# under different systems.  Several R programs are actually thin wrappers around
# python libraries, so the python
